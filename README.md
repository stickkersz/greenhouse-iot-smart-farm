## What it does

An ESP32 reads air temperature/humidity (SHT35) and water temperature (DS18B20), then drives a **fan** and a **water pump** to keep a greenhouse in range. It works **fully offline** — the control loop reads sensors and thresholds from RAM/NVS, so a Wi-Fi or Firebase outage does not stop climate control. When online, it pushes live data to Firebase every 30 s and polls remote commands every 1.5 s.

A browser dashboard (Firebase Hosting) shows live readings, historical charts, and lets staff switch each channel between **AUTO / MANUAL / SCHEDULE**, tune thresholds, and load seasonal presets.

Three independently deployable layers:

| Layer | Source | Deployed by | Runs on |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Firmware** | `smartfarm_firmware/` | `arduino-cli upload` (flash) | ESP32 |
| **Rules** | `database.rules.json` | `firebase deploy --only database` | Firebase cloud |

> ⚠️ A firmware behavior change only takes effect after **flashing** the ESP32. Rules and dashboard only govern what can be *saved* — they do not change what a running board does with its current config.

## Hardware

**Board:** ESP32 DevKit V1

### Sensors

| Sensor | Interface | Measures | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SHT35** | I2C `0x44`/`0x45` (SDA=GPIO21, SCL=GPIO22) | air temp + humidity | drives all auto control |
| **DS18B20** (waterproof) | 1-Wire GPIO4 (needs 4.7 kΩ pull-up) | water temp | **alert/display only** — does not drive relays |
| **LCD 16×2** | I2C `0x27`/`0x3F` (shared bus) | — | local status display |

> I2C addresses are auto-detected at boot by a bus scanner. SHT35 address depends on its ADDR pin.

### Relays (active-LOW: LOW = ON)

| Channel | GPIO | Load | Controlled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CH1** | 26 | สำรอง (spare) | manual / schedule only — no auto |
| **CH2** | 27 | ไม่ได้ใช้ (unused) | hidden in dashboard, forced OFF |
| **CH3** | 14 | พัดลม 220 V AC (ดูดเข้า) | **temperature + humidity** (auto) |
| **CH4** | 25 | ปั๊มน้ำ 24 V DC | **humidity + pump safety** (auto) |

### Other pins

| Pin | GPIO | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Buzzer | 33 | 3-pin module, active-LOW |
| Status LED | 2 | onboard |

> CH4 pump moved from GPIO12 → GPIO25 (GPIO12 is a strapping pin that caused boot failure). Do not move it back.

## Auto-control logic

Pure decision math lives in **`smartfarm_firmware/auto_control_logic.h`** (`computeAutoDecisions()`), separated from Arduino I/O so it can be unit-tested with plain `g++`.

Four hysteresis **latches** are computed from air sensor readings:

| Latch | ON when | OFF when | Drives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **hot** | temp ≥ `temp_on` | temp ≤ `temp_off` | fan |
| **dry** | humidity < `humidity_min` | humidity ≥ `humidity_max` | fan + pump |
| **pumpHeat** | temp ≥ `temp_on` | temp ≤ `temp_off` **or** humidity ≥ `humidity_max` (humid gate) | pump only |
| **wet** (vent) | humidity ≥ `humidity_vent` | humidity ≤ `humidity_vent − VENT_HYST` | fan only |

**Outputs:**

```
fanOn  = hot OR dry OR wet
pumpOn = (hot AND pumpHeat) OR dry
```

**Key invariants (all covered by the test sweep):**

- `pumpOn → fanOn` — the pump never sprays with the fan off (would flood, not evaporate).
- Pump is blocked while air is saturated (`humidity ≥ humidity_max`) — spraying into saturated air just floods.
- **`humidity_vent ≥ humidity_max + VENT_HYST`** is *required*. Otherwise there is a humidity band where the fan vents moisture out while the pump sprays it back in. This is enforced in firmware, rules, and dashboard.
- Sensor unreliable (`sensor_ok = false`, or humidity ≤ 0) → **everything off, all latches cleared**. SHT35 gives temp + humidity from one chip, so a failure means both readings are stale.

**Why latches instead of stateless comparisons:** two hysteresis loops OR'd statelessly either stick open or chatter at the deadband edge. Pump relay switching is the confirmed cause of this project's air-sensor latch-up, so the pump must never chatter. See the header comments and `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`.

### Default thresholds (`config.h`)

| Threshold | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `temp_on` | 35 °C | fan/pump engage |
| `temp_off` | 32 °C | fan/pump release |
| `humidity_min` | 60 % | pump engages (too dry) |
| `humidity_max` | 75 % | pump releases (saturated) |
| `humidity_vent` | 80 % | fan vents excess humidity (must be ≥ `humidity_max` + 5) |
| `VENT_HYST` | 5 % | vent latch deadband (single source of truth in `auto_control_logic.h`) |

### Seasonal presets (dashboard)

| Preset | temp_on/off | hum_min/max | vent |
|---|---|---|---|
| ☀️ ฤดูร้อน (summer) | 33 / 30 | 70 / 85 | 90 |
| 🌤️ ปกติ (normal) | 35 / 32 | 60 / 75 | 80 |
| 🌧️ ฤดูฝน (rainy) | 38 / 35 | 50 / 65 | 85 |

All three sit exactly on the `vent = humidity_max + VENT_HYST` boundary — which is why the constraint is `≥`, not `>`.

## Setup — firmware

**Prerequisites:** [`arduino-cli`](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/) with the `esp32:esp32` core (3.3.10).

1. **Create `config.h`** (required — build fails without it; it's gitignored because it holds secrets):

   ```bash
   cp smartfarm_firmware/config.h.example smartfarm_firmware/config.h
   ```

   Then edit `config.h`: set Wi-Fi SSID/password(s), `FIREBASE_HOST`, `FIREBASE_API_KEY`. Pins and thresholds already have working defaults.

2. **Compile** (the `sketch.yaml` profile pins the board, partition, and library versions):

   ```bash
   arduino-cli compile smartfarm_firmware
   ```

   > ⚠️ `PartitionScheme=huge_app` is **required** — the firmware is ~1.4 MB, over the "default" partition's 1.31 MB limit. It's baked into `sketch.yaml`. In Arduino IDE: Tools → Partition Scheme → "Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)".

3. **Find the port and upload:**

   ```bash
   arduino-cli board list
   arduino-cli upload -p /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX smartfarm_firmware
   ```

4. **Watch serial** (115200 baud) — banner should read `=== Greenhouse IoT Smart Farm v2.9.0 ===`.

---

## Setup — Firebase & dashboard

**Prerequisites:** [`firebase-tools`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli), a Firebase project with Realtime Database (region `asia-southeast1`). Project alias is `greenhouse-iot-smart-farm` in `.firebaserc`.

```bash
firebase login
firebase deploy --only database    # push security + validation rules
firebase deploy --only hosting     # push the dashboard
```

The dashboard is a single self-contained `dashboard/index.html` (loads Firebase compat SDK + Chart.js from CDN). Firmware version shown in the header reads live from `status/firmware`.

---

## Configuration reference

Everything device-specific lives in **`smartfarm_firmware/config.h`** (gitignored). Sections:

- **Wi-Fi** — `wifiNetworks[]`, auto-connects to whichever is in range (WiFiMulti).
- **Firebase** — `FIREBASE_HOST`, `FIREBASE_API_KEY`.
- **Pins** — see [Hardware](#hardware). `RELAY_ACTIVE_LOW` / `BUZZER_ACTIVE_LOW` flip polarity if your modules are wired the other way.
- **Thresholds** — boot defaults; overridden live from Firebase `control/thresholds` and persisted to NVS.
- **Timing** — `SENSOR_INTERVAL` 30 s, `LOG_INTERVAL` 1 h.

> **Never commit `config.h`.** It contains Wi-Fi passwords and the Firebase key. Only `config.h.example` (placeholders) is tracked.

---

## Firebase data contract

`database.rules.json` is the source of truth for validation (`"$other": {".validate": false}` rejects any undeclared field silently). Full detail in `Firebase_Database_Structure.md`.

```
smartfarm/
├── sensors/         air_temp, air_humidity, water_temp, uptime_sec   (ESP32 → dashboard, 30s)
├── control/         relays, modes, thresholds, schedule              (dashboard → ESP32, 1.5s poll)
├── status/          sensor_ok, water_ok, firmware, boot diagnostics  (ESP32 → dashboard)
├── alerts/          latest alert                                     (ESP32 → dashboard)

└── action_log/      user action log                                  (dashboard writes)
logs/YYYY-MM-DD/HH/  hourly avg/min/max + sample_count                (ESP32 → dashboard, hourly)
```

> `logs/` is at the **root**, not under `smartfarm/`.

Auth model: ESP32 uses **anonymous auth** (can write sensors/logs/status/alerts, cannot write thresholds). Dashboard users are **email-authenticated** (can write control + read everything). Editing a field requires changing firmware **and** `database.rules.json` **and** adding a test in `tests/database.rules.test.js`.

---

## Testing

No build step — tests match the project's vanilla approach.

```bash
npm test              # runs both suites
npm run test:rules    # Firebase rules via emulator (requires firebase-tools + Java)
npm run test:logic    # auto-control logic via g++ (C++17)
```

- **`test:logic`** compiles `tests/auto_control_logic.test.cpp` against `auto_control_logic.h` and runs crossing/hysteresis/sensor-fail cases plus exhaustive invariant sweeps. Because the vent clamp lives *inside* the pure function, the sweep exercises the real shipped code (mutating `VENT_HYST` makes tests fail).
- **`test:rules`** spins up the RTDB emulator (port 9000) and asserts every accept/reject path, including the vent/max/min cross-field constraints and partial-update guards.

Run both green before flashing or deploying.

---

## Deployment checklist

**Order:** firmware first (or simultaneously). No order breaks the current live config, but only flashing changes what a running board does.

1. `npm test` → both suites green.
2. `arduino-cli compile smartfarm_firmware` → clean (~44% flash on huge_app).
3. Flash the board, watch serial for `v2.9.0`.
4. `firebase deploy --only database` then `--only hosting`.
5. **Verify on hardware** (per this project's incremental-testing practice — host tests are not a substitute for a real SHT35):
   - Banner reads `v2.9.0`.
   - On a humid test, vent arms at RH ≥ `humidity_vent` (`[AUTO] พัดลมเปิด (...ชื้นเกิน...)`).
   - **No** `[AUTO] ⚠️ ปิด vent` warning on a valid config (that means firmware thinks the config is unusable).
   - Pump and fan never run in a way that violates `pumpOn → fanOn`.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `config.h: No such file` at compile | didn't create config.h | `cp config.h.example config.h` and fill in |
| "Sketch too big" / text section exceeds | wrong partition | ensure `huge_app` (it's in `sketch.yaml`; IDE users set Partition Scheme) |
| Board reboots at boot | pump on a strapping pin | CH4 must be GPIO25, not GPIO12 |
| Relays inverted (ON = OFF) | module polarity | flip `RELAY_ACTIVE_LOW` in config.h |
| Buzzer always sounds | active-HIGH module | set `BUZZER_ACTIVE_LOW false` |
| `[AUTO] ⚠️ ปิด vent` in serial | `humidity_vent < humidity_max + 5` | raise vent or lower humidity_max |
| Dashboard "save" does nothing | rules rejected the write | a toast now reports it; check values against constraints |
| Sensor badge shows stale | SHT35 read failing | check I2C wiring; firmware self-heals via periodic re-init |
| `test:rules` fails to start | emulator needs Java | install a JDK; ensure firebase-tools installed |

## Design notes & history

- **Auto control is offline-first** — never depends on Wi-Fi/Firebase. Config persists in NVS across reboots.
- **Air sensor is single point of failure by design** — SHT35 gives temp + humidity from one chip; on failure everything shuts off safely rather than acting on stale data (chosen 2026-07-15).
- **`VENT_HYST` lives in three layers** (`auto_control_logic.h`, dashboard `VENT_HYST_PCT`, rules literal `5`). The C++ side is single-source and mutation-tested; the other two are comment-linked. Tuning it means editing all three.
- Full changelog is at the top of `smartfarm_firmware.ino`. Deeper rationale, incident history, and hardware gotchas are in `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`.

**v2.9.0** (latest) — fixed "Wi-Fi drops repeatedly and never reconnects, while phones/PCs on the same AP are fine". Four compounding bugs, all on the reconnect path (the boot path was fine, which is why a reboot appeared to fix it):

1. **Modem sleep was on** (ESP32 STA default `WIFI_PS_MIN_MODEM`) — the radio naps between beacons, misses them, and drops with reason 200 `BEACON_TIMEOUT`. Phones don't power-save this way, hence the asymmetry. Now `WiFi.setSleep(false)`. ⚠️ Costs ~20-40 mA average; if `last_reset_reason` starts showing `BROWNOUT` more often after flashing, suspect the power rail first.
2. **Core auto-reconnect raced `wifiMulti`** — `run()` calls `WiFi.disconnect()` mid-attempt, killing the core's in-flight reconnect. Same class of bug as the old `Firebase.reconnectWiFi(false)` fix, which counted only two radio managers and missed that the ESP32 core is a third. Now a 45 s grace window lets the core retry the same SSID alone (fast, no scan); only after that does `wifiMulti` take over and sweep all SSIDs.
3. **`run()` was called with no argument** in `loop()`, taking the library's 5000 ms default while boot used 15000 — the reconnect path was 3× more impatient than boot. Busy APs routinely need more than 5 s for assoc + DHCP. Now 20000 ms.
4. **Every other retry was a dead round** — a failed `run()` calls `markAsFailed()`, so the next round skips that AP as a candidate, ends with `bestIndex == -1`, and never calls `begin()` at all, while still paying the 3-5 s blocking scan. Now the fail flags are cleared after each failed attempt via `APlistClean()` + re-add (`resetFails()` is private).

Plus: radio power-cycle (`WIFI_OFF` → `WIFI_STA`) after 3 consecutive failures, ahead of the existing one-shot 30-minute reboot; and Wi-Fi disconnect diagnostics (`status/wifi_drop_count`, `status/wifi_drop_reason`) pushed to the dashboard, in the same spirit as `last_reset_reason` from v2.2.0 — previously the logs said only "dropped" / "back", with no way to tell why.

**v2.8.0** — fan now rests with the pump: 15 min max runtime, 5 min shared cooldown (reverses the v2.6.0 decouple, per on-site instruction; accepts the temperature-overshoot trade-off). Follow-up review fixes: no false water alarm when the fan alone triggers cutoff, `status/fan_locked` reports real state again, and both cooldown locks are now set regardless of channel mode so flipping a channel manual→auto mid-cooldown can't let the pump run with the fan locked off.

**v2.7.1** — fixed a pump-vs-vent conflict window (vent must now be ≥ `humidity_max` + `VENT_HYST`), moved the vent clamp into the testable pure logic, added reciprocal guards on `temp_off`/`humidity_min`, and hardened dashboard validation/feedback.
